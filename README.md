# hello-world
My first repository

Hello all,

Chadwick here, I am excited to learn more about Github and web applications. One quick thing about myself is that I am a huge Lord of the Rings fan, both movies and books. I have several figurges and artwork on my desk and recieved a full movie script for the fellowship of the rings for Christmas.
